# Pitchbook

## Overview and Origin

PitchBook Data provides software services covering venture capital and private equity markets. It was founded in 2007 by John Gabbert and is based in Seattle, Washington. He cut his teeth in the financial services industry by working at VentureOne Corporation in a variety of roles, includeding director of operations leading Human Resources. The idea for data mining came about from VentureOne’s database on venture companies that Mr. Gabbert thought was insufficient in scope. He wanted to incorporate information from private equity newsletters and alternative investment providers. He received funding to start Pitchbook after pitching it to over two hundred investors. Initial funding happened in 2007 and by 2016 the company had received approximately $15 million; they were acquired by Morningstar for approximately $180 million in October of that year.

## Business Activities:

PitchBook provides desktop and mobile applications for both firms involved in venture capital and private equity, but also for more established companies that would be interested in mergers and acquisitions such as Deutsche Bank and Samsung. The application can be used to build financial models, do comparable company analysis, and create data visualizations. While Pitchbook does provide information available publicly, their primary strength is information in private finance. They provide dates of fund raising, pre/post valuation, number of shares issued, dividend rate , original issue price, liquidation preference multiples, and voting rights (not exhaustive): each broken down by series issued. In addition, they provide information such as uncalled capital, IRR, and cash flow multiples. Pitchbook has invested heavily into machine-learning with natural language processing to enhance their product. In 2018, Pitchbook’s had used their web mining tools and news collection technology to process over 30 billion words. The data they scrape is provided to users of their software through a third party content delivery network such as Amazon CloudFront. The extraction of scraped data that is processed into relevant information to be added to the Pitchbook database is built in-house, but based upon LinkedIn information the transformer machine learning model may be involved.



## Landscape:

Private financial markets have grown considerably over the past decade, with approximately $2.4 trillion assets under management in 2010 to $6.5 trillion assets under management in 2020. In that same timeframe, the public market had grown by one hundred percent. The value of private equity companies has grown more than eightfold since 2000. Tech-focused PE funds have generated IRRs six percentage points higher than those of non-tech in the last decade. Private equity firms have been a relative late comer in being disrupted by fintech as more focus has been on payments, cryptocurrency, and retail investors. A number of firms have been using automated investment decisions using AI such as Correlation Ventures and GV. The availability of hard-to-find data and presenting it easily to the end-user lets Pitchbook help firms make their investment decisions quicker and more accurate. Some of Pitchbook’s competitors in providing data to private market firms include PrivCo, CB Insights, and DataFox.

## Results

As of 2018, Pitchbook had grown to over one thousand employees and revenue was $99.6 million. Pitchbook covers over 695,000 companies through their product. In the meantime, the PE firm industry has averaged and IRR of over 21 percent since the financial crisis of 2008. Going forward, data will continue to be key to making good decisions in private equity; Pitchbook is one way firms can gather and analyze data. While Pitchbook never went public, it was acquired by Morningstar in 2016. In comparison, PrivCo has growned to over one hundred employees and DataFox has raised $13.6 million in funding and was acquired by Oracle in 2018 for an undisclosed amount.


## Recommendations

Ability to sync with Salesforce CRM and export to LinkedIn SalesNavigator. This will allow VC and PE firms to easier connect with other companies or high net worth individuals through social media and help them communicate with new clients. This would use Salesfoce API and JSON. This would help firms’ investor relations locate and communicate new business opportunities over social media after using the data that Pitchbook provides.
